Welcome to the Modern Translation blog by R!

On this blog, I will share various translation-related tricks and lifehacks I have learned over the years, mostly related to CAT tools, file formats and Python scripting. It will get technical, although I will try to make the learning curve smooth. 

This is the type of knowledge I wish I had had before, as it would have saved me long hours of tedious work. I hope it can make the lives of fellow translators easier.
