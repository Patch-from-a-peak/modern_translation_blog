**Warning:** Blog post under construction, still need to add content.

*This is a series of blog posts on file formats used by CAT (Computer-assisted translation) programs for storing translation data. Their aim is to share some knowledge which should allow us to tame our CAT tools better. Or to become independent from their whims.*

*This post discusses ways of editing file types often used by translators - XML files and archives - without actually using a CAT tool. If you want to learn about these files first see [Part 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-05-11-translation-formats-intro.markdown %}).*

## Prerequisites

In order to tinker with translation files, you will need a few programs:

- A **text editor** for opening files (on Windows, you can use the default Notepad or the free [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/))
- A program for **opening zip archives** (on Windows, you can use the free [7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html))
- A **CAT tool** of your choice (e.g. the free [OmegaT](https://omegat.org/download))
